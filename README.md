# Motor_Control

# This project is Part of NTI 4-month Initiative for trainning to real world Projects

# 1. System should ask the user to enter duty cycle , then read it using keypad .
# 2. System should ask the user to enter frequency, then read using keypad 
# 3. Using this Duty cycle and frequency you should produce a PWM with these parameters.
# 4. Drive a DC motor with this PWM .
# 5. System should be able to accept a new duty cycle and frequency and should change the speed and frequency during RunTime.
